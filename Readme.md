This repository provides a machine learning solution to predict customer churn in the telecom sector. The project combines data exploration, feature engineering and model evaluation.
The goal is to help telecom companies reduce churn by identifying high-risk customers before they leave.

---

### 🔍 Objectives:
- Clean and prepare telecom customer data
- Make The Data Balance through Two Techniques (SMOTE, OverSampling)
- Engineer features from categorical and numerical data
- Train classification models (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluate models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

---

### 📊 Dataset Features:
- Demographics (Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents)
- Account info (Contract Type, Tenure, Payment Method, Billing)
- Service usage (Internet, Phone Lines, Streaming, Tech Support)
- Churn label (Yes/No)

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies:
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for EDA & model training

---

### 🧠 Model Performance:
| Metric     | Value   |
|------------|---------|
| Accuracy   | 90%     |
| Precision  | 95%     |
| Recall     | 85%     |
| F1-Score   | 90%     |
------------------------
